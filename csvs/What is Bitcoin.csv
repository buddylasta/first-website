"Read The Bitcoin Whitepaper written by bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto."
Check out some bitcoin fundamentals below. This is your foundation. The rest of the resources will help you build on this!

"Money Fundamentals

To understand why we need bitcoin, it’s important to understand money itself. Read this twitter thread by John Cantrell for an excellent breakdown."

"Bitcoin Practical Fundamentals

1. Freedom to receive
2. Freedom to hold
3. Freedom to send"

"Bitcoin Monetization Path

1. Store of value
2. Medium of exchange
3. Unit of account (hyperbitcoinization)"

"Bitcoin Monetary Fundamentals

- Divisible: 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis (sats)
- Portable: Information that can be sent through a communications channel or stored in your head
- Fungible: UTXO sets allows bitcoin (or sats) to be sent in any amount. Multiple bills can be used to make up $20. Same concept.
- Durable: Incorruptible ledger secured by miners and verified by nodes
- Scarce: Algorithmically enforced supply of 21,000,000 units (technically slightly less) that can't be changed."

"Bitcoin Technical Fundamentals

- Decentralized: no single point of failure
- Terminal inflation = 0: Fixed supply of 21,000,000 bitcoin (technically slightly less)
- Predictable supply schedule: block reward halves every 210,000 blocks
- Permissionless: anyone can use the protocol
- Trustless: no third party required to transfer information from 'A' to 'B'
- Peer-to-peer: no trusted third parties
- Proof of work: secures the network
- Difficulty adjustment: major innovation of Bitcoin that maintains the fixed supply schedule
- Fungible UTXO sets
- Censorless: nobody can stop a Bitcoin transaction
- Verifiable: run your own version of the software to verify the ledger for yourself (Don't trust, Verify)
- Uses Public-private key cryptography
- Reliable: 24/7/365
- Open source: anyone can see the code, contribute to the project, build tools and add layers on top of Bitcoin. Adaptable.
- Secure: secured by miners - the most secure computing network in the world
- Universal: anyone with an internet connection can use Bitcoin"
