# Coding my first website 

Ever since I learned about html and css I've wanted to code my own site. I was inspired by the simplicity of twitter user @bitcoinqna's [site](bitcoiner.guide). I utilized the table design from his site in mine. I've always loved retro video game art hence the pixel imagery throughout the main page. 

Big shoutout to my buddy Mitchell Cizek for a lot of the pixel art! He did it all through [pixil art's site](www.pixilart.com/draw). I made a few images myself but they didn't turn out as nice :(. 

Anyways, check out the site! If you find value in it, donations are welcome at the bottom. Thank you and hopefully this provides value to you.

### Github Pages

- First create a CNAME record in your DNS settings that points your subdomain to (user).github.io. Then point A records to github's servers. [Here is the guide](docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). 

- Create a branch dedicated to your website. I created gh-pages. Then make sure the html file you want to use for your site is in the root directory. 

- Your website is now ready to go. Make sure you test it out on different browsers!


### To Do List 

- figure out how to incorporate my sats converter in this page (maybe create sats converter repo -> github pages with subdomain buddylasta.com/sats-converter -> use link in index.html)
- set a dark mode option color for my background (black p tag text won't show on phones with dark mode enabled)
