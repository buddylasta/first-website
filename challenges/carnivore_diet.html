            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p> 
                Discover the pros and cons of the carnivore diet through experimentation. Optimize health, productivity, and learning.
            </p>

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>
                A couple of weeks before 11/1/2021, my girlfriend randomly said we should try the carnivore diet. I was taken aback because
                she's the last person I expected to utter those words. However, I couldn't have been more thrilled to hear them. For those of
                you who don't know, I'm a doer. I pursue challenges that test my mental and physical limits. Why? Because I truly believe 
                each challenge helps me become a stronger, better me. I typically pursue athletic challenges like the Manhattan Lap, the 
                treadmill marathon, and running 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours. Trying a diet, especially the carnivore diet, is a new one.
                I was a collegiate wrestler so I'm no stranger to diets and eating clean to lose weight, but losing weight is no longer my goal. I simply 
                want to live a healthy life that allows me to feel and operate at my best. Is the carnivore diet the way to the do that? Maybe. Keep reading
                to learn more.
            </p>

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Hours after my girlfriend said we should try the carnivore diet I decided to do it. I whipped out our living room whiteboard 
                and crafted a challenge. Here's what I wrote: <br>

                Start: 11/1/2021 <br>
                End: 12/1/2021 <br>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Carnivore Diet: only eat meat and animal products (no fruits, no veggies, no protein powder)</li>
                    <li>Drink 80oz to a gallon of water a day</li>
                    <li>Drink 1 @drinklmnt electrolyte packet a day</li>
                    <li>Workout once or twice a day</li>
                    <li>Booze: only allowed to drink Tequila</li>
                    <li>Finish 2 books</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>FAIL TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS? START OVER!</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now you're probably wondering why I chose the things I did. Here's my reasoning:
                <ol>
                    <li>Only eat meat and animal products to see how the carnivore diet makes me feel</li>
                    <li>Stay hydrated by drinking 80oz of water or more a day</li>
                    <li>There is very little sodium in the carnivore diet. Drink 1 @drinklmnt packet a day to get sodium and other essential minerals (Thanks for the advice @lindalin.love)</li>
                    <li>Workout once or twice a day to look good, feel good, and get stronger</li>
                    <li>If I drink, only drink tequila because it stabilizes blood sugar (Thanks for the advice @lindalin.love)</li>
                    <li>I've easily learned more about health, money, privacy, etc this year than I have any other year of my life. Keep the momentum
                        going by reading informative books.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Looks pretty simple right? Now let's talk about how I got started.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                I did about 1 hour of research prior to starting this challenge. That research consisted of skimming through 
                revero.com, a website dedicated to coaching and helping people through the carnivore diet. After reading through it,
                I stumbled upon a familiar website butcherbox.com. I had heard about it via Joe Rogan's podcast and gave it a look. Butcherbox.com
                makes it easy to get grass-fed, non-GMO, cuts of meat in a box delivered directly to your home. Buying it was a no brainer. As someone who 
                wanted to try out different cuts, I ordered a mixed box with salmon,
                beef, chicken, etc. Big mistake. Looking back, I wish I would've only purchased beef since I quickly realized it's my favorite cut. But no regrets. 
                My girlfriend also purchased organs (beef heart, beef liver, femur bones, and oxtail) from acabonacfarms.com. 
                As I waited for my box of meats to arrive, I started mentioning the challenge on instagram. To my surprise, a lot of people DM'd me with pieces of advice. 
                Big thanks to all of you for the cooking tips!
            <br>
                I started the challenge 11/1/2021 without the butcherbox since it was set to arrive 11/3/2021. No worries tho. I jotted down my weight which was 167.0lbs (pictured below)
                first thing in the morning. Ignore the temp tattoo on my chest. It was a Halloween decoration haha. Then I bought some meats from the nearest grocery store to 
                hold me over until the box arrived. 11/3/2021 all of my cuts of meat arrived frozen, perfectly packaged and ready to go.
            <br>

        </p>


            <h2>The Benefits</h2>
            <p>Here's the part you've all been waiting for. The benefits. I'll list each benefit out one at a time with 
                The Carnivore Diet book's explanation as to why it occured. 
            <br>
            <br>
                <i>
                    Note: I didn't finish the Carnivore Diet by Shawn Baker 
                    until the last few days of this challenge. Many of the benefits mentioned in the book are exactly what I felt within the 
                    first 10 days. 
                </i>

                <h3>Benefit #1: Sustained Energy</h3>
                On day 1, I only consumed beef patties, chicken, and bone broth. I had high, sustained energy the entirety of the day. It was easily the best I'd felt in ages. 
                All that energy even made it hard to sleep! Day 1 could've been a fluke tho so I needed to monitor this further. After 30 days, I can say that this benefit persisted
                even on the days I got poor sleep due to traveling. I also had little to no electrolytes in me on Day 2 which made that a low energy day, but 
                the @drinklmnt packets fixed that. I've been far more productive at work and in my personal life thanks to this extra energy.

                <h4>Book's Explanation of Benefit #1</h3>
                I can't quite find a quote that attributes a specific explanation to this benefit. However, it is reported by many carnivore dieters including me.
                I'd imagine less inflammation, high nutrient density, no fiber, and no junk food is key.
                

                <h3>Benefit #2: Eating Less</h3>
                Pre-carnivore diet, I was accustomed to eating three full meals and snacks throughout the day. On this diet, I only needed to eat twice; 
                once in the morning and once in the evening. Most days I had no snacks. Now I didn't do this on purpose. I simply didn't feel hungry. Each meal 
                left me satisfied.

                <h4>Book's Explanation of Benefit #2</h4>
                "If you feed yourself low-quality carbohydrates that are rich in energy but low in nutrients (micronutrients, essential fats, and amino acids), you
                won't be satisfied. Your hunger won't be appeased, and you'll eventually fall prey to cravings for more and more food..." (Carnivore Diet pg 91).
                <br>
                Basically if you eat more nutrient dense foods, you'll be more satisfied. You'll also eliminate certain cravings.

                <h3>Benefit #3: Aches and Pains Disappeared</h3>
                I've had chronic lower back pain for as long as I can remember. I definitely got it from wrestling half of my life.
                On day 4 I noticed it was gone while I was running. All of my ankle, knee, hip, and other pains also disappeared. 
                I suspect this diet rid me of lots of inflammation.

                <h3>Benefit #4: Getting Leaner</h3>
                On Day 4 I also noticed I was already a bit leaner in my abdominal region. Again, I attributed this to less inflammation, bloating, etc.

                <h3>Benefit #5: Carb and Sugar Cravings Dissappeared</h3>
                I don't quite recall when the cravings stopped but it was probably around day 5. The only 
                time they come back is in specific contexts i.e. at the movies. I always buy reese pieces at the movies so not 
                having them there was tough.

                <h4>Book's Explanation of Benefit #5</h4>
                Simply put, you stay hungry when you don't eat nutrient dense foods. You feel satiated when you do. Meat is full of nutrients.
                Lots of carbs and junk food are not. Frequent hunger leads to cravings.

                <h3>Benefit #6: Lower Anxiety</h3>
                Many people don't know this but I get incredibly anxious in social situations. It ususally susbsides after
                immersing myself in the situation for a few minutes so it's not a big deal. However, I noticed many of those 
                anxiety inducing situations no longer bothered me after about 8 days on the diet. I felt more at peace and almost 
                numb. This is one of my favorite benefits of the diet :). 

                <h4>Books Explanation of Benefit #6</h4>
                "Taurine is found in high levels in both meat and fish but is woefully absent from a plant-based diet....
                In animal studies, taurine has been shown to reduce anxiety. Perhaps that is one reason so many folks
                on a carnivore diet report a sense of calmness and a resolution of anxiety." (Carnivore Diet pg 70)

                <h3>Benefit #7: Living in the Kitchen</h3>
                I practically lived in the kitchen. Every meal I ate required seasoning, the instant pot, stove, or the oven.
                Luckily, I work for home so I was able to prepare each meal and eat it fresh. Prior to the diet, I cooked maybe once 
                every other day. Now I cook 2-3 times a day and I actually enjoy it! Cooking every single meal is great because you're less
                likely to eat junk due to more control over the ingredients you add to your meal. Meat is also very easy to cook. I gained 
                a newfound appreciation for cooking. I now have the urge to go through the entire meat process: hunting it, getting it processed, and 
                finally cooking it.

                <h3>Benefit #8: Eczema Disappeared</h3>
                I have eczema on the bottoms of my feet. It started occuring in my early 20s and has persisted since. After about two weeks 
                on this diet, it disappeared completely. I learned that people with autoimmune diseases and rashes tend to see them disappear 
                on low carb diets. 

                <h4>Book's Explanation of Benefit #8</h4>
                "When our intestinal permeability is high, we're susceptible to developing what we call
                a "leaky gut" which is an issue that's now thought to be involved in a number of disease states. Leaky gut and autoimmune diseases 
                are highly correlated. Dr. Toth has found that changing the components of the diet markedly affects the intestinal permeability, and
                the most problematic things we ingest are plant oils, medications, and supplements. The second most problematic group includes grains,
                legumes, nightshade plants, dairy, and sweeteners..." It was found that a meat-based diet normalizes intestinal permeability, decreases
                inflammation, and helps clear up autoimmune issues. Start reading The Carnivore Diet pg 82 for more info.

                <h3>(TMI) Benefit #9: Little to no Pooping and Farting</h3>
                Before starting this diet, I assummed eating meat all day would lead to bloating, constant pooping and farting.
                The complete opposite occured haha. I think I didn't poop once between days 7-9. I was a bit worried I was constipated, 
                but I had no discomfort at all. In fact, I felt fantastic. After reading more of The Carnivore Diet, I realized it's completely normal. 
                Here's why.

                <h4>Book's Explanation of Benefit #9</h4>
                "Most people on a high-fiber diet are accustomed to daily (and often multiple daily) bowel movements. Going on 
                a carnivore diet will dramatically reduce the volume of waste you produce, and it will likely lead to less frequent 
                bowel movements...What many people mistake for constipation, particularly early on in the diet, is just a dramatic
                reduction in waste. Instead of seeing half the organic fruits and vegetables that you paid a premium price for going 
                down the toilet as indigestible fiber, you now will produce a tiny fraction of waste." (The Carnivore Diet pg 105)

                <h3>Typical Benefits</h3>
                The book notes that people who embark on this diet tend to have a reduction in blood pressure, insulin resistance, inflammation,
                and body fat. People also report feeling more energized as aches and pains go away and they often feel the desire to move a bit more often. 
                Autoimmune disease issues and rashes tend to go away as well. For many of you out there, you might be looking for a diet to lose weight. I've
                always found that to be the wrong approach (except for my wrestling days). This diet may lead to weight loss, but there's no guarantee. In my opinion,
                your goal should always be to maximize nutrition. Everything else will fall into place.
                <br>
                If I read this book before noticing these things, I may have tossed it up to the placebo effect. But I read this book well after I noticed all 
                of these benefits and more. Wild what a diet can do to you.
            </p>

            <h2>The Cons</h2>
            This diet had one major drawback. Traveling! I flew home a week before Thanksgiving to go hunting and to see family.
            I prepped zero food in advance. Big mistake. Airports aren't known for their carnivore diet friendly meals. So I was stuck eating 
            expensive jerky from kiosk shops. I did manage to order beef patties from one restaurant, but everything else was unenjoyable. 
            I also bounced around 5-6 different households and restaurants while I was home so buying meat, cooking it, and staying satisfied 
            was not an easy task. Luckily, my family and friends were accommodating. Interestingly enough, I learned that a few 
            family and friends dabbled in the carnivore diet. After hearing about my journey through it, some decided to give it another try.
            Big takeaway from this experience is to prepare jerky, bacon, and other foods before getting on the road.

            <h2>Objections</h2>
            A friend of mine who followed the carnivore diet for a few months messaged me saying the diet is very stressful on the body long term.
            According to him, the diet taxes your adrenals, endocrine system, and crashes your hormone profile long term. I have no idea if this is true or
            not, but I'll take the next few months to learn more and find out. We always need to keep learning. Nutrition and health are topics that are not
            set in stone.

            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            This diet left me feeling amazing and at my best. I plan on continuing to eat mostly meat, but I won't be as strict.
            If I go to the movies and want reese piece's, I'll eat some damn reese piece's. But I will continue to order meat via butcherbox,
            I will continue to add @drinklmnt packets to my water, and I will continue to optimize my health. My goal now is to 
            find new ways to cook my favorite meat cuts, start making my own jerky, and learn how to properly cook organ meats.

            <h2>Would I Recommend it to a Friend?</h2>
            Absolutely. I recommend reading The Carnivore Diet by Shawn Baker or going through Revero.com to learn a bit more about the diet.
            If you like what you read, give it a try for at least ten days and see how you feel. I noticed almost all of my listed benefits within ten days, but 
            I'm sure it's a bit different for everyone.

            <h2>Here's what my day-to-day was like:</h2>
            <p>

                <br><strong>Day 1:</strong>
                <br>Food: Ate beef patties, chicken, and bone broth. No coffee
                <br>Water: Gallon of water
                <br>Workouts: Cardio in the afternoon, legs in the evening
                <br>Description: Had high energy all day. Shocked at how good I feel. Best I've felt in ages! Hope I can sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><strong>Day 2:</strong>
                <br>Food: Chuck roast, chicken breast, ribs, bone broth
                <br>Water: Gallon of water
                <br>Workouts: Cardio (2 miles, 10min interval on bike)
                <br>Description: No food prep before starting the work day is tough. Did cardio in the morning. Ate chuck roast, chicken, and bone broth directly after cardio.
                Didn't eat ribs till the evening. Butcherbox and acabonacfarms.com meat boxes arrive soon though so prep won't be an issue. Found great barbecue and steak 
                sauces from Primal Kitchen that are organic and sugar free. Can't wait to try them with eggs tomorrow. Lastly, noticed my energy was low towards the end of 
                the day because of all the water I'm drinking without electrolytes. @drinklmnt electrolyte packets should arrive tomorrow!
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><strong>Day 3:</strong>
                <br>Morning Food: 5 eggs + chuck roast + Primal Kitchen bbq sauce
                <br>Evening Food: Chicken drumsticks and chicken breast
                <br>Water: 1 Gallon plus @drinklmnt packet
                <br>Workouts: Back/Pull in the morning, HIIT at night
                <br>Description: Felt really good eating 5 eggs and chuck roast right after my lift in the morning. Crushed water before working out and throughout the day. 
                The @drinklmnt electrolyte packet is amazing. Felt much better after adding it to my water mid-day. That kept me satisfied until post-evening workout. 
                Cooked up some grass-fed drumsticks and chicken breast for dinner. Time to sleep and get ready for cardio in the AM.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><strong>Day 4:</strong>
                <br>Food: 5 eggs in the morning, chicken at night
                <br>Water: 1 Gallon
                <br>Workouts: Interval Run + body weight exercises in the morning
                <br>Description: Morning workout was fantastic. Endurance and strength feel superb. 
                <br>Lots of aches and pains are gone; most notably my lower back pain. Getting noticeably leaner already. 
                <br>Have loads of energy despite getting used to waking up early for morning workouts. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><strong>Day 5:</strong>
                <br>Morning Food: 5 eggs in the morning 
                <br>Evening Food: Chicken breast
                <br>Water: 1 Gallon
                <br>Workouts: Cardio and arms at night
                <br>Description: Felt great all the day until post-workout. Obviously need to fuel up more after workouts. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><strong>Day 6:</strong>
                <br>Morning Food: 5 eggs and sausage
                <br>Evening Food: Meat snacks and ham
                <br>Water: 1 Gallon
                <br>Workouts: Cardio 
                <br>Description: Woke up exhausted since I didn't fuel up well after my workout last night. The eggs, sausage, and electrolyte packet brought me back to life. 
                Starting to crave sugary foods, but holding strong. Maybe going to the movies last night triggered my sugar cravings. I do always eat reese pieces there :(. 
                Hosted a housewarming and ate meat snacks all night. Also enjoyed some high quality tequila + electrolyte packet.

                Went up to central park for some nature in the concrete jungle, but quickly realized that was a mistake with the NYC marathon going on. 
                After about 3hrs, went back home and cooked up some steak to end the night. Starting to notice the effects on my digestive system. 
                I went two days without going "number 2", but finally did today. Hope I'm alright lol.

                <br>Description: Another day in the life. Woke up a bit leaner and feeling fantastic. No keto fever over the last few days because I've been on top of my electrolytes. 
                Spent an hour reading more Carnivore Diet by Shawn Baker. Realized I have had little to no gas and bloating at all. I literally haven't farted all day lmao. 
                Also learned that my anxiety may be down because meat contains a lot of Taurine. A studied effect of taurine is lower anxiety. No wonder plants and carbs had my anxiety high af all the time. 
                Also realizing fiber was likely the cause of all my bloating pre-carnivore diet.

                Been receiving a lot of DMs from friends on Instagram. Absolutely love how engaged people are with this stuff. Cool to hear objections to what I'm doing, tips for cutting meat, etc. Keep it coming!

                I was able to crush cardio and arms today with plenty of energy left in the tank.

                <br>Description: Another glorious day in the life of eating animal products. My dreams have been wild lately. Could it be because of my pineal gland decalcifying from less fluoride in my system (thanks tooth powder and brita filter)? Who knows. 
                Maybe eating clean and feeling great is helping, too. Anyway, really starting to lean out especially in my arms. Drinking 80oz + of water has become an easy habit and the @drinklmnt packets are doing their job. Life's good.

                <br>Description: Tried liver for the first time...makes me want to be a dier. It was really gross but I ate all of it because Im not missing out on those nutrients. A friend of mine recommended Ancestral Supplements Freeze Dried Liver as a replacement. 
                I'll give that a try going forward. Cooked up some Steak in the evening. My tastebuds applauded.

                <li>Only order meat cuts I know I like. I got sick of trying new things</li>
                <li>Prep food for traveling. Traveling was easily the hardest part of this diet. Thank the lord restaurants sell individual beef patties</li>
                <li>Stay away from cheese...full stop. Cheese is allowed since it's derived from animals, but my stomach clearly doesn't like it. Bloating is how it showed its disdain. Luckily I didn't eat much of it</li>
